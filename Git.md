### Summary of Git Concepts and Commands

#### Overview of Git

- **What is Git?**
  - Git is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) created by Linus Torvalds.
  - It operates on various platforms including Windows, Linux, and macOS.

#### Installing Git

1. **Download Git**:
   - Visit [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) and download the appropriate 64-bit package for your operating system.
   
2. **Install Git**:
   - Follow the installation instructions for your OS.

3. **Configure Git**:
   - Set your global configuration with:
     ```sh
     git config --global user.name "your username"
     git config --global user.email "your email address"
     ```
   - Check your configurations with:
     ```sh
     git config --global --list
     ```

#### Version Controlling a Project

1. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**:
   - Use the terminal or Git Bash to navigate to your project folder.

2. **Initialize Git**:
   ```sh
   git init
   ```
   - This creates a `.git` directory and starts tracking your project.

3. **Add Files to Staging Area**:
   ```sh
   git add <filename>
   ```
   - Replace `<filename>` with the name of the file you want to stage.

4. **Commit Changes**:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "commit message"
   ```
   - This saves the staged changes with a message describing the commit.

#### What Happens When Git is Initialized

- **`.git` Directory**: Created in your project directory to store all version control information.
- **Master Branch**: Created as the default branch that holds all your commits.
- **HEAD Pointer**: Points to the latest commit. Initially, it points to the first commit you make.

   - **Commit History**: Each commit includes:
     - **Commit ID**: A 40-character alphanumeric string.
     - **Author**: The person who made the commit.
     - **Date**: Timestamp of the commit.
     - **Commit Message**: The message you provided.

- **Viewing Commit History**:
  - Use:
    ```sh
    git log
    ```
  - For a shortened view:
    ```sh
    git log --oneline
    ```

#### Revisit Previous Commits

1. **Temporary Approach - Checkout**:
   - To switch to a specific commit:
     ```sh
     git checkout <commitid>
     ```
   - To return to the latest commit on the master branch:
     ```sh
     git checkout master
     ```

2. **Permanent Approach - Reset**:
   - **Types of Reset**:
     - **Hard Reset**: Deletes commits and changes.
       ```sh
       git reset --hard <commitid>
       ```
     - **Soft Reset**: Deletes commits but keeps changes in the staging area.
       ```sh
       git reset --soft <commitid>
       ```
     - **Mixed Reset**: Deletes commits but keeps changes in the working directory.
       ```sh
       git reset --mixed <commitid>
       ```

This summary covers the basics of initializing Git, committing changes, and managing commit history, including revisiting and resetting commits.

### Understanding `.gitignore` and File Tracking in Git

#### Scenario

You have a project with 10 files:

- `index.html`
- `main.css`
- `script.js`
- `script2.js`
- `script3.js`
- `robots.txt`
- `logo.png`
- `banner.png`
- `dividers.png`
- `main2.css`

You want to commit only `index.html` to Git, while ignoring the other 9 files. Here's how you can manage that:

#### Steps

1. **Initialize Git**:
   ```sh
   git init
   ```

2. **Add and Commit `index.html`**:
   ```sh
   git add index.html
   git commit -m "Committed index.html"
   ```

3. **Check Git Status**:
   ```sh
   git status
   ```
   At this point, the other files (`main.css`, `script.js`, etc.) will appear as untracked.

4. **Create a `.gitignore` File**:
   - Open a new file called `.gitignore`:
     ```sh
     nano .gitignore
     ```
   - Add the names of the files you want to ignore:
     ```
     main.css
     script.js
     script2.js
     script3.js
     robots.txt
     logo.png
     banner.png
     dividers.png
     main2.css
     ```
   - Save and close the file (in `nano`, use `Ctrl + S` to save and `Ctrl + X` to exit).

5. **Verify Ignored Files**:
   ```sh
   git status
   ```
   The files listed in `.gitignore` should no longer appear as untracked.

#### What if a File Already Tracked by Git is Added to `.gitignore`?

- **Tracked Files**: If you’ve committed a file to Git (e.g., `main.css`) and then add it to `.gitignore`, Git will **not** stop tracking changes to this file. The file will still appear in `git status` if it’s modified.
  
- **Untracked Files**: Files listed in `.gitignore` that were never committed will be ignored by Git. They won’t appear in `git status` and won't be included in future commits.

#### Stopping Tracking for an Already Tracked File

If you want to stop tracking a file that is already committed and is now listed in `.gitignore`, you need to remove it from the staging area:

```sh
git rm --cached <filename>
```

This command will:

- Remove the file from the Git index (staging area).
- Keep the file in your working directory.
- Ensure that the file is ignored in future commits, as long as it is listed in `.gitignore`.

### Summary

- **`.gitignore`** only affects files that are not yet tracked by Git.
- To stop tracking files that are already committed, use `git rm --cached <filename>` and then commit the changes.

This approach helps you manage which files are tracked by Git and which are ignored, keeping your repository clean and focused on relevant files.

Your notes on Git branching are spot on! Here's a quick overview and some additional details:

### Creating Branches
- **Create a branch**: `git branch <branchname>`
- **Create and switch to a branch**: `git checkout -b <branchname>` or `git switch -c <branchname>`

### Switching Branches
- **Switch to an existing branch**: `git checkout <branchname>` or `git switch <branchname>`

### Listing Branches
- **List all branches**: `git branch`

### Key Points
- A branch starts as a copy of the branch it was created from, inheriting all its commits.
- **Remote branches**: If you're working with remote repositories, you might need to fetch updates to see remote branches (`git fetch`) or view remote branches (`git branch -r`).
